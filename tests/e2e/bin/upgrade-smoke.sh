# Installs the last release of the OpenCart 4 extension in the E2E shop,
# places an order on it, then swaps this checkout in over it and re-runs
# dev/configure.php, as the staging shops do on every deploy. Passes when every
# setting the release stored is kept and the checkout spec still places an
# order. Without a tag it upgrades from the newest release tag from 2.0.0 on;
# with none (before the first release of the rewrite) it skips, saying so. The
# 1.x tags are the OpenCart 3 extension, which has no upgrade path to OpenCart 4.
