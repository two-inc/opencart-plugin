/**
 * The merchant record from Two (Build Guide sections 16 and 18): terms grid,
 * buyer countries, surcharge settings. Cached through the SettingsStore with
 * no expiry, refreshed by the scheduled job and on settings save, so checkout
 * never waits on Two for it.
 *
 * - The cache is bound to the credential fingerprint: a record fetched for
 *   other credentials is not served, but it is not dropped either.
 * - A failed refresh, on any path, leaves the cached record in place. Only a
 *   successful fetch replaces it.
 * - A 200 that answers none of the record's questions (a captive portal, a
 *   proxy page) is a failed fetch, never a merchant with no restrictions.
 * - Reading the record stands in for a schedule that is not running: a cold
 *   cache is fetched on read (at most every RETRY_COLD seconds), and a record
 *   older than STALE_AFTER is refetched on read (at most every RETRY_STALE
 *   seconds, with a short timeout since a buyer may be waiting). Every
 *   attempt (read, save or schedule) is stamped before the call, so
 *   concurrent reads share one.
 *
 * Readers of individual fields (terms, buyer countries, minimum order) land
 * with the phases that use them (P6, P7); this class holds the record whole.
