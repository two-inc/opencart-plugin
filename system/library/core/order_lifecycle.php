/**
 * The placed order's lifecycle at Two, driven by the merchant's status maps
 * (Build Guide section 12): moving an order into a mapped fulfilment status
 * fulfils the whole Two order, into the mapped cancel status cancels it.
 * Plus the invoice download once the order is fulfilled.
 *
 * - Whole orders only: Two's partial fulfilment is done in the Two merchant
 *   portal. Refunds (OrderRefunds) and order-edit sync (OrderEdit) have
 *   their own classes.
 * - Idempotent: the stored Two state and then Two's live state decide
 *   whether anything is sent, so a repeated event or a re-save never fulfils
 *   or cancels twice. Each call also carries an idempotency key
 *   (IdempotencyKey), which Two honours today only on partial fulfilments
 *   and refunds.
 * - Before fulfilling, the order's own rows (products, totals, addresses)
 *   must still hash to what was stored when Two confirmed it, so Two never
 *   invoices an order the merchant has since edited. Only data the order
 *   owns is used: a deleted product or a new tax rate does not block it.
 * - Outcomes are plain arrays. Every outcome but SKIPPED carries a reason
 *   for the order history, so the merchant always sees what happened; the
 *   merchant's status change itself is never undone.
