/**
 * Order-edit sync (Build Guide section 12.1): when a placed order's own rows
 * (lines, totals, addresses) change before it is fulfilled, the order is
 * rebuilt and, if its payload hash differs from the one Two last accepted,
 * sent as `PUT /v1/order/{id}`.
 *
 * - Runs off the order history event, which OpenCart's order edit fires
 *   once the edited rows are written, so every edit path is covered.
 * - The rows hash is the trigger and the payload hash the test: a tax setup
 *   change alone never sends an edit, and an edit that changes nothing Two
 *   holds (a product's model code) sends nothing.
 * - Keyed `edit_<two order id>_<hash>`, chained on the last accepted edit's
 *   key (the create key for the first edit). Each accepted edit stores its
 *   key, payload hash and rows hash, so the later fulfil check passes.
 * - When the outcome is unknown (no answer, or a 5xx) the stored payload
 *   hash is cleared, so the next save always sends the order as it then is,
 *   even edited back to what Two last accepted, and fulfil waits until Two
 *   has accepted it. The key repeats as long as the order is unchanged.
 * - An edit Two refuses as such (400, 422) keeps its rows hash, so the same
 *   edit is not sent or noted again; a different edit is. A 408 or 429 is
 *   handled like no answer, and any other 4xx (a key being changed, a
 *   conflict) records nothing, so the next save sends the edit again.
 * - After fulfilment an edit is refused with a note, never sent: Two has
 *   invoiced the order as it was.
